Sri Lanka has a population of approximately 22 million
and is home to many cultures, languages and ethnicities.
The Sinhalese people form the majority of the population,
followed by the Sri Lankan Tamils, who are the largest minority
group and are concentrated in northern Sri Lanka; both groups
have played an influential role in the island's history.
